Conducting  lessons  in  a  fun  and  exciting  way  boosts  better  understanding  and  it                enhances the Joy of Learning. Thus, the idea of learning idioms and proverbs through                 comic writing was conceptualised. Some pupils used the ‘Pixton’ application to create                 the comics while others put their artistic skills to the test. This project started in 2019 as                a  MT  Fortnight  activity  for  P4  pupils.  Selected  pieces  of  pupils’  work  were  compiled,                 published into a book and distributed to our pupils. This year, we decided to create e-                books.  Our  decision  to  continue  this  project  digitally  was  fuelled  by  factors  such  as                 increased readership ,  better accessibility of this material and being environmentally-                friendly. In addition, we would like to emphasise the inculcation of values through digital                 platform.                  This project aims to achieve the following:                       To create a story in comic form to express pupils’ understanding of proverbs they                         have learnt.                      To motivate pupils to write in a fun and creative way as they are able to represent                         their ideas in visual and written form.                       To engage pupils through thinking, creating and writing.                      To help in the organization of ideas through storytelling and storyboarding                       To scaffold composition writing  techniques through visual-verbal connections                  We approached the learning of idioms and proverbs through comic writing in 2 stages.                  Stage 1 – Pupils to read and understanding the idioms and proverbs they have learnt.                 Stage 2 – Pupils to create pictures and dialogues for the chosen proverb using Pixton.                    We hope that through reading these comics you will have a better understanding of                 what idioms and proverbs are.","4","Sheyenne Chua Hui Qin ( 4 Resilience)                                                                                   见怪不怪 – (Happens often enough that it is no longer a surprise)                         The student was late to school.
